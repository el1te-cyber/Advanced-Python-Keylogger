Simple Python keylogger that logs data and transmits it through discord's webhook system. This script also includes the window the client is in when the keystrokes are typed. <br/>
Features:
1. Grabs keystrokes
2. Transmits data
3. Shows window

How to use:
1. Download the script.
2. Edit the "WEBHOOK_URL" variable to include the url of the discord webhook you would like to use to send the data to.
3. Run the script on the target machine.
4. The data should go into the discord channel the webhook is linked to.<br/>

Cons:
1. Detected by any antivirus (if you know how to bypass please let me know in the "Issues" section)
2. It is very blatant because it does not have any other software in the script so all it does is log keys. This might arouse suspicion of the client.<br/>
